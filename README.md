# Movie-Reviewer-DB
The movie_reviewer.py script starts a CLI program, which uses python and SQL to add a reviewer and review tables to the Sakila database,
allowing the user to sign in as a reviewer and review a movie from it by giving it a rating from 0 to 9.9, with only one decimal digit allowed.

This was done as part of a DBS course exercise, in addition to the several SQL queries.
